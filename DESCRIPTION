Description: We propose a method to estimate the probability of an 
    undetected case of COVID-19 in a defined setting, when a given number of 
    people have been exposed, with a given pretest probability of having 
    COVID-19 as a result of that exposure. Since we are interested in undetected
    COVID-19, we assume no person has developed symptoms (which would warrant 
    further investigation) and that everyone was tested on a given day, and all 
    tested negative.
